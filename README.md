# Instructions for setting up of AWS S3 for interfacing with REST API's for using it in WebAPPS.  

*  Log on to https://aws.amazon.com/free/ and create a free tier account which is generally enough for small webapps.       
*  Go to https://aws.amazon.com/console/ and enter your credentials for logging in (by default you are root user).

* Make sure you are on the similar console as shown above.

> Note : bucket creation as follows below can also be done by code but i generally like AWS UI for this purpose and all other work can surely be done using code obviously.  

* Now, click on ```Services``` drop down menu, select ```S3``` under ```Storage``` section.     
* click on ```create bucket``` as shown below.

* Now, follow the instructions as below for creating your first bucket on s3.    
> Note1 : bucket-name should be unique identifier.
> Note2 : Regarding Blocking Public permissions : If you just have to read and write on the objects stored in s3 , then you can keep the blocking permissions On but since i am using it for rendering files on the web (like images, videos) so, i am disabling any blocking permissions as if left on, these can override any permissions on individual objects even though they are public.

* Now, you should have your bucket showing up on your S3 console.       
* Now, click on bucket-name and then move to ```Permissions``` section and then select ```Bucket Policy```.      
* You can edit the policy by creating a new policy (at the end, it is given -```policy generator```).       
* Follow the instructions as shown below to create policy  - This is make sure that every default object uploaded to the container becomes public so that we can render the files directly on the web.           

> Note : In the policy generator section, we need ARN which you can get from your bucket-policy section, generally it's something like - 
aws:s3:::bucket-name and you just need to append "\\" at the end of arn while entering the form.

* Now, paste the code generated by clicking on ```Add statement``` and copy the code and paste it in bucket-policy editor.

* Now, you have made the policy for making all the uploaded objects public.    

* Then, just a last step for getting the credentials to access the S3 API using Python library boto3.   
* Create IAM roles for getting full control over the s3 buckets.        
* Follow the steps below and get your credentials.    
* Now, again select ```Services``` drop down menu and select ```IAM``` from  ```Security, Identity, & Compliance``` section (you can also search IAM in the search bar and select it).     
* Now, select Users and click on Add user.

* Then follow below instructions for creating your IAM roles and getting your credentials.

* Now, select ```AmazonS3FullAccess``` as shown below.    

![aws](/img/iam_3.JPG)              

* Skip the ```add tags``` section and click on Next.    

* Now, review your policy and on the screen you have your API access Id and API access secret key , keep them safe by copying it or downloading as csv.         
* Now, you can interface S3 with boto3 (python module) for accessing S3 with your obtained credentials.    

ðŸŽ‰ Great, you have now got your AWS S3 API credentials with full access over s3.
